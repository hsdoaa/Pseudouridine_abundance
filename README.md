# Pseudouridine_abundance
predict Pseudouridine sites on the complete RNA sequence of Hela and Hek293 cell lines

1- run predict_Pseudouridine_sites.py to predict the Pseudouridine sites in complete direct RNA Nanopore sequence of any cell line. The script takes two arguments:

-The labeled dataset of direct RNA Nanopore sequence of the cell line with predifined Pseudouridine locations
-The unlabled dataset with of direct RNA Nanopore sequence of the cell line with undetermined Pseudouridine locations

2- run Pseudouridine_unique_locations.py to get  the unique genomic locations of Pseudouridine sites in the complete RNA direct RNA Nanopore sequence of any cell line
